# Fomin Report Builder

_Flexible runtime report building for Clarion applications—either by developers and/or end users._

**Fomin Report Builder** (FRB) is a powerful runtime reporting engine designed for Clarion for Windows. With deep integration into Clarion (ABC and Legacy) FRB gives your applications a second wind—letting users create and customize their own reports _without touching source code_.

Whether you're an independent developer maintaining legacy systems or a corporate team extending Clarion-based solutions, FRB bridges the gap between developer efficiency and end-user autonomy.

## 🔍 What Makes FRB Different?

Unlike static report procedures that bloat application binaries and rely on developers to make every change, FRB stores report forms as `.rpt` files—compact, independent, and user-editable. Reports can be designed, exported, imported, printed, and sorted without recompiling anything.

Whether you're managing hundreds of reports or granting on-site teams independence, FRB reduces turnaround time and increases application longevity.
