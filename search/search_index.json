Fomin Report Builder (FRB) is a powerful runtime reporting engine designed for Clarion for Windows. With deep integration into Clarion 2.0 through Clarion 5 (ABC and Legacy), and compatibility well into modern versions, FRB gives your applications a second wind\u2014letting users create and customize their own reports without touching source code . Whether you're an independent developer maintaining legacy systems or a corporate team extending Clarion-based solutions, FRB bridges the gap between developer efficiency and end-user autonomy. \u2728 Why FRB? Empower users : Let non-technical users design, format, and filter their own reports at runtime. No royalties : Distribute the FRB DLL freely with your compiled applications. Multi-language support : Built-in English and Russian UI, with full localization via FRB_NLS.INI . ABC and Legacy friendly : Complete support for both Clarion template chains. Modern design ethos : Familiar Word-like layout controls make users feel right at home. \ud83d\udce6 What You\u2019ll Find in This Documentation This documentation is a modernized and expanded guide to everything FRB can do, including: \ud83d\udee0 Installation and Setup : How to register templates, deploy DLLs, and add FRB to your project. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Developer Guide : Learn how to integrate FRB with your application's data and templates. \u270d\ufe0f Using FRB : Empowering end-users to build and manage reports, with helpful tips and screenshots. \ud83e\udde9 Components : Dive deep into RBC-library, the FRBC template set, ReportManager, and more. \ud83d\udcda Glossary : Definitions and examples of FRB terminology and report elements. \ud83d\ude4b Support : Community resources, FAQs, and direct contact with the original developer. \ud83d\udd0d What Makes FRB Different?

Reports can be designed, exported, imported, printed, and sorted without recompiling anything. Whether you're managing hundreds of reports or granting on-site teams independence, FRB reduces turnaround time and increases application longevity. \ud83d\udcdc License & Availability FRB 1.5a for Clarion 2.0 is Freeware .
